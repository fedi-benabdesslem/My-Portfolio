# Portfolio 2026

> **"Rigorous Logic meets Artistic Code"**

Welcome to my personal portfolio—a digital playground where precision engineering converges with interactive visual art. This project is a showcase of modern web technologies, featuring immersive 3D environments, physics-inspired animations, and a polished, high-performance UI.

## ✨ Features

- **Immersive 3D Experience**: A scroll-reactive, procedural planet simulation using `Three.js` and `React Three Fiber`.
- **Dynamic Interactivity**: Physics-based scroll effects, where elements breathe, rotate, and shift based on user interaction.
- **Modern Design System**: Built with a custom, high-contrast dark theme using `TailwindCSS v4` and sophisticated typography.
- **High Performance**: Powered by `Next.js 16` (App Router) with `React 19` Server Components for lightning-fast loads.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with the cutting-edge ecosystem:

- **Core**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router), [React 19](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) (Icons)
- **3D & Motion**:
  - [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber): Declarative Three.js
  - [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei): Useful helpers for R3F
  - [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): Complex 2D animations
  - [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/): Smooth scrolling
